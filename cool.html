    <h1>And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</h1>
    <div class = "begin">
    <p>Tell them I hate them. No argument here. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
    <p>Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? <strong> That's not soon enough!</strong> <em> Your best is an idiot!</em> Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "rotate">
      <h2>We're rescuing ya.</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class = "middle">
    <p>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Why did you bring us here? Okay, I like a challenge. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>No! The cat shelter's on to me.</li>
      <li>And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</li>
      <li>I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <h3>It must be wonderful.</h3>
    <div class = "end">
    <p>Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. You can see how I lived before I met you. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…</li>
      <li>And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</li>
      <li>This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You wouldn't. Ask anyway! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.</p>
    <p>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Say what? But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>
    <p>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.</p>
    <p>I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</p>
    <p>Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</p>
    <p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.</p>
    <p>Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.</p>
    <p>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Is that a cooking show? Okay, I like a challenge. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
    <p>The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Soon enough. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.</p>
    <p>Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? They're like sex, except I'm having them! Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</p>
    <p>Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Can I use the gun? Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Oh, I think we should just stay friends.</p>
